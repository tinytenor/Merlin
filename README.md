# merlin
This is one of the games found in the merlin handheld game. Each of the buttons does different things to the board. 
The corner buttons change the color of the 4 buttons in that corner. The middle buttons on the sides invert the row or column. 
The middle button changes the 5 middle buttons. The game is won once all the outer buttons are green and, the middle one is red. 
Ignore the venv folder if you are ok with installing dearpygui and random separately.
